# ðŸ§¬ Conwayâ€™s Game of Life â€“ Python GUI

An interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Tkinter. This simulation lets users draw an initial pattern on a grid, then start, pause, resume, or reset the evolution process. Built as a hands-on exploration of GUI programming, event-driven logic, and basic cellular automata.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click or drag to toggle live cells (10Ã—10 grid).
- **Start / Pause / Resume**: Control the simulation with buttons.
- **Reset**: Clear the grid and reset the generation counter.
- **Real-time Animation**: Grid updates every 0.5 seconds using Tkinterâ€™s `after()` method.
- **Dynamic UI**: Responsive buttons and generation counter update in real time.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The grid is a 2D list (list of lists) representing cell states (1 = alive, 0 = dead).
- Mouse input is used to set initial states before simulation starts.
- The simulation uses the standard Game of Life rules:
  - Live cell with 2â€“3 neighbors â†’ stays alive.
  - Dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors â†’ becomes alive.
  - All other cells â†’ die or stay dead.
- The simulation updates periodically using Tkinterâ€™s event loop (`.after()`).
- GUI elements (buttons, canvas) are managed with `tkinter.Frame`, `Button`, and `Canvas`.
